Now my aim is to make an agentic ai chatbot that will first take in an image of the skin disease, then the model will return it's 
__________________

Now it is time to create the full multi modal agentic ai chatbot.
1st create the vector db where I will store the chunks from a medical book pdf. Then store on pinecone using this notebook. create the whole agent workflow where first the use will upload the image, the swin transformer(from hf api call), then the agent will get the disease. From the Vector DB(from pinecone using pinecone api) the agent will fetch symptoms that the patient might feel. Then the agent will ask the patient one by one about each symptom(Self thought loop). Then once the agent is sure about the disease it will return the results, treatment, etc. BUT IT WILL MENTION THAT IT IS JUST A DUMB AGENT DONOT TAKE THESE INFORMATION FOR FACEVALUE, THIS IS JUST A SIDE PROJECT FOR LEARNING PURPOSE. do all the logic inside gradio only, also use it for the frontend. I want to deploy this project on hf spaces. do not create a fastapi backend for this. I want full modularised code for this this is a rough structure for you to follow for the agent as I am familiar to these project structure for agentic ai projects-
