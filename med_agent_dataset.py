I understand your concern. The preliminary image analysis shows some markers that require attention. Let me ask you a few important questions:

1. How long have you had this mole?
2. Have you noticed any changes in its size, shape, or color recently?
3. Does it itch, bleed, or feel different from other moles?
4. Do you have a family history of skin cancer?

Based on the chest X-ray showing bilateral infiltrates and your symptoms, this appears to be pneumonia. Let me gather more details:

1. Is your cough producing any phlegm? If yes, what color?
2. Are you experiencing shortness of breath or chest pain?

Thank you for the additional information. The blurry vision is another important sign. These symptoms together - increased thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), fatigue, and blurry vision - are classic indicators of diabetes.

<diagnosis>
Based on your symptom pattern:
1. **Preliminary Diagnosis**: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (high probability)
2. **Reasoning**: 
   - Classic triad of symptoms present
   - Blurry vision from osmotic changes in the lens
   - Awaiting lab confirmation (HbA1c, fasting glucose)

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Blood glucose testing (fasting and HbA1c)
   - Complete metabolic panel
   - Lipid profile
   - Urinalysis

4. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Monitor blood sugar if you have a glucometer
   - Stay hydrated
   - Avoid high-sugar foods
   - Schedule lab work urgently
</diagnosis>

This requires prompt medical attention. Please see a healthcare provider for lab tests within 24-48 hours."""}
